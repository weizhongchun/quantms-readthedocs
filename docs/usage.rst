Installation and usage
==========================

The quantms pipeline is built using `Nextflow <https://www.nextflow.io>`__, a workflow tool
to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner.
It comes with docker/singularity/podman... containers making installation trivial 
and results highly reproducible.

The pre-requisites to run quantms are:

- `Nextflow <https://www.nextflow.io>`__
- Container environment: `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`_,
  `Singularity <https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/>`_,
  `Podman <https://podman.io/getting-started/installation>`_ 
   
.. note:: If you want to download locally the quantms workflow you should also install 
          `git in your environment <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_


Installation steps
---------------------------

1. Installing `Nextflow <https://nf-co.re/usage/installation>`_

2. Install either `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`_, 
   `Singularity <https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/>`_ or
   `Podman <https://podman.io/getting-started/installation>`_,
   see nf-core guidelines for basic 
   `configuration profiles <https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles>`_

3. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

You can get the pipeline in two different ways:

Manual download with git directly from github:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   git clone https://github.com/bigbio/quantms
   cd quantms

This will store a local copy of the pipeline, in order to be able to run it you should run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   nextflow run main.nf -c nextflow.config -profile test_lfq,<docker/singularity/podman/institute>

You can use nextflow to directly pull from GitHub:

.. code-block:: bash

   nextflow run bigbio/quantms -profile test_lfq,<docker/singularity/podman/institute>

.. note::
   By default, the above command will use the latest released version of the quantms pipeline.
   If you wish to use the development branch, add the ``-r dev`` parameter:

   .. code-block:: bash

      nextflow run bigbio/quantms -r dev -profile test_lfq,<docker/singularity/podman/institute>
.. note:: Please check `nf-core/configs <https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation>`_ 
   to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. 
   If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. 
   This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution 
   settings for your local compute environment.

By using container environments (e.g. Docker, Singularity or Podman) quantms users 
do not need to install any dependency, software or tool manually. Using 
container environments helps quantms guarantee reproducibility and reliability of the analysis.

Usage
-------------------

Start running your own analysis!

.. code-block:: bash

   nextflow run bigbio/quantms -profile <docker/singularity/podman/institute> \
      --input '*.mzml' \
      --database 'myProteinDB.fasta' \
      --expdesign 'myDesign.sdrf.tsv'


See `usage docs <https://nf-co.re/quantms/usage>`_ for all of the available options when
running the pipeline. Or configure the pipeline via
`nf-core launch <https://nf-co.re/launch/quantms>`_ from the web or the command line.

.. warning:: 

   `Conda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_ is not supported by quantms from
   version ``1.4.0`` onwards.
